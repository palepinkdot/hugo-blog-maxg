# Why blog?

I's not a blog... next question.

# Then WTF is this?

Okay, fine I guess it's a blog. Not a blog for my inner thoughts and crises, but rather one for my expereince as a Software Engineer (or Developer depending on who you ask...).

I've learned over a relatively small amount of time that I do some pretty interesting and niche things from engineering and building software solutions (and I guess including) to messing around in my homelab. This will more or less serve as a repository for documenting my problem software solving, how I go about things in my lab, and anything else I might find intersting.

I don't expect this to be of service for many people, but if I can spend 6 hours wracking my brain over some wierd way to deploy a web-service, I'll gladly put some good karma into the world.

###### _Footnote: I say "homelab" but what I really mean is "sitting-in-my-parents-basement-lab"._
