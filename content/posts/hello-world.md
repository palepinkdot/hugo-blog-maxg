# Why blog?

I's not a blog... next question.

# Then WTF is this?

Okay, fine I guess it's a blog. Not a blog for my inner thoughts and crises, but rather one for my expereince as a Software Engineer (or Developer depending on who you ask...)

I've learned over a relatively small amount of time that I do some pretty interesting things from engineering and building software solutions (and I guess including) to messing around in my homelab.

**Sidenote: I say "homelab" but what I really mean is "sittinginmyparentsbasementlab".**
